It's March of 2021.

During our lunch break, my CTO and I are wandering around the empty streets of London.

At one point, I mentioned that I would love to start speaking at the conferences and that my goal is to have the first talk by the end of next year.

I didn't know what to expect. Were conferences still a thing with this situation in the world?
Never mind, I had a dream.

And stayed faithful to it.

## Let's Apply

Fast-forward to June 2021.

I was looking for conferences to attend and stumbled across Vue.js London. My beloved framework in my beloved city  —  I must go!

A mate from the company and I agreed about going and bought the tickets.

The conference itself was massive, and I knew that. It's the second biggest Vue.js conference in the world.

But my dream about speaking was still there. And it was strong.

A few weeks earlier, I wrote an article about structuring a massive Vuex store. The article became kinda viral and it was very well accepted.

"Why wouldn't I convert this article to a talk?!"  —  passed through my mind.

So, I did.

On a wonderful Saturday morning, I sat down with my laptop and filled in a talk application. The article helped a lot, making the talk description very detailed and structured.

I told that to almost nobody.

Even though I was aware that the conference is huge and that I should probably start with something smaller, the idea of me speaking on it was quite alive.

I often imagined myself on the stage, giving a talk in front of a bunch of people.

"Nah, you're not big enough for this"  —  the mind sometimes used to nag.

But I kept ignoring it.

I am allowed to dream, right?

## And It Suddenly Happened

Let's fast-forward again. It's September 2021.

I'm sitting in the office; my mind is filled with JavaScript.

Suddenly, an email arrives:

<img src="https://orbitalwitness.com/hubfs/vuejs-accepted-talk-email.png" alt="accepted-talk-email" />

<figcaption>I'VE GOT IT!</figcaption>

I instantly became extremely overhyped. I couldn't sit anymore.

But I felt like it's inappropriate to stand up and start jumping around the office in front of everyone.

So, I stood up, went to the rooftop, and started jumping around where nobody could see me.

I was so high on my emotions. Priceless.

I called my sister because I had to share it with someone. The call was amazing.

At one point, I had to return back. And I'm coming as nothing has happened.

Still, I was smiling all the time.

The euphoria was so strong.

## You'll Have a Remote Talk… Or Not

My goal was to have a talk in person. I was doing that in my imagination, why wouldn't that materialise?

But because of a wild schedule, my talk was supposed to be a remote one.

I was still perfectly fine with it. It's my first conference anyway and it's so huge, anything will be amazing.

---

Then, a few weeks later, another email arrives. One speaker wasn't able to make it to London and speak in person  —  therefore, an empty slot appeared.

"Domagoj, would you mind taking it?"

"YES!"

## The Day Finally Arrives

The 20th of October is here.

I'm waking up after a great night of rest.

Just to be sure, I'm rehearsing the talk for the last time. Even though I've done it probably 23 times already.

I know everything I want to say. It's cool. I'm ready.

The venue is 15 minutes away from me by foot. For London, that's means we're almost neighbours.

I'm arriving there, feeling so good.

We've had dinner with the speakers and organisers the evening before  — so I've already known a lot of people.

Interesting conversations with interesting people have started.

At one point, the first speaker started his talk. I knew that I will be there in a heartbeat.

Here we go.

Our top MC announced my name, gave a short introduction, and handed me over the stage.

And suddenly, I'm there.

In front of everyone.

Interestingly, I felt so chilled. To be honest, I sometimes used to be more anxious during the rehearsal. At that moment, I was so light.

I started speaking, and everything went so well.

It was better than the best rehearsal I've ever had.

## After Effects

The day was just incredible.

I've met so many great people. All of them were coming to me, saying they were impressed with my talk. My Twitter inbox has almost collapsed.

---

This story ends, but the story of me speaking has just started. I'm excited about my next endeavours.

Let's create even better stories.
