I've been seeing a lot of content around coding recently, saying things like "everyone can learn to code" or "coding is easy".

Yep, I truly believe anyone can learn to code. But let's face it, it's not easy.

It's hard. **Really hard.**

Which is a pretty good thing, and you'll find out why in a few minutes.

But what's the motivation behind this article?

**Well, I don't want you to start learning to code, and then get demotivated and give up because "it's so easy and everyone's doing it, but you can't".**

Let's break the bias.

## Complex problems throughout my career

There are some things that can be easy.

Changing a background colour with CSS?

Hmm, let's Google it. The solution is here. I tried, it works. NICE!

**But sometimes, it's not that easy.** You find a solution, but it's not a good one. Yet, you don't know about that â€” and introduce tech debt immediately.

It can get worse.

There are many problems that took me hours, or even days to solve. And I've been fighting with code for 7+ years.

But it's not only me.

There were many times when we couldn't solve bugs for weeks or months. Tech leads with 15+ years of experience were working together, with no results.

Many problems/bugs were left unsolved.

Why?

**BECAUSE CODING CAN BE PRETTY DAMN HARD.**

If many incredible engineers with 15+ years of experience can't solve a problem, doesn't that alone prove the above statement?

## Comparison with other skills

Besides being a Senior frontend engineer, I'm also a content creator.

I **LOVE** video editing.

And I use Premiere Pro for it.

But I'll be honest and say â€” **it's so easy compared to coding.**

I'm not saying Premiere Pro is bad because it's easy; actually, exactly the opposite. If there's a way to accomplish something in life in an easy, non-time-consuming way â€” go for it! That's a definition of smart work.

And one more statement â€” Premiere Pro is definitely not easy compared to other skills. But compared to coding, it is.

Every problem I had in Premiere Pro was solved in less than 5 minutes by Googling or watching a short YouTube video about it.

I'm not a "Pro" Premiere Pro user, and I'm sure there are way more complex things to do (which require way more time to learn).

But using it after coding, it feels so easy.

And that's just one of the powers that coding gives you. When you learn how to code (and develop that problem-solving mindset), many other skills in life become so easy.

## Why is coding so hard?

Let's take a comparison with Premiere Pro once again. (don't hate me for this, I love PP)

When I want to edit a video, I already have an approximate final video in mind. So I import files to Premiere Pro.

Sometimes I need to zoom in on a video, other time add a fire effect, and next thing adds some extra layers and animate them... Whatever the problem is, it's going pretty smoothly, and I can easily find the solution.

On the other side, let's say I want to build an app. Once again, I have a final app in mind; maybe even designs.

Aaaaaand... If you don't have a lot of experience, you don't have a clue what to do.

You're Googling all the shit possible, copying everything, you're so happy when it works from the 10th time.

Ok cool, now you need to add this button here and submit the form on the click, relatively simple.

But what happens when you need to integrate the map into your app, add navigation that overlays the map, add smooth dragging gestures, change different states of the map based on selections, optimise everything to make it work with 1000+ items on the map, and make a reusable component out of it that can be used everywhere across the app?!

**WHAT. THE. FUCK.**

And that's just one of many challenges you'll encounter.

They are hard because to solve those large problems, you need to divide them into smaller ones. Sometimes, you need to divide those smaller ones, too. And again, and again. And you don't know when, what, or how to divide.

Dividing large problems into smaller ones is an essential skill in coding. It takes months, years, and sometimes even decades to master it.

## Why is it SO GOOD that it's hard?

We already mentioned one of them â€” when you learn how to code, many other things in life become easy. Your problem-solving skills are applicable everywhere.

Also, your value in the world is determined by how replaceable you are. The less replaceable you are, the higher your value is.

Because it takes way more effort to learn to code than any other skill, many won't even try. That's why you have way less competition to replace you, especially in this world where coding skills are in such demand.

## Should you learn to code?

It doesn't matter if something in life is easy or hard. The only question is - **do you want to do it?**

If so, do it. Smart work often requires hard work.

It's better to invest time in something hard that truly interests you, rather than picking something "easy" just because it's easy.

We live in an illusion that we discovered everything, but we're actually at the beginning.

**Technology is so underdeveloped.**

We've just started building this incredible digital world, and it already has more importance than material world to some people.

And that will just continue to grow.

Even myself â€” I earn 100% of my income in the digital world!! I prefer to spend it in material one though ;)

By understanding the digital world, you have the power to access a different dimension that not many people in this world can. Everyone can just use the end result (e.g. apps), but you're the one who creates them.

Don't get demotivated if you can't learn how to code quickly - nobody can. It requires a lot of time, effort, experience, and collab with other more experienced engineers.

It's okay to not know and understand things in coding. The field is so massive that even after years of experience, you still won't understand loads of stuff. **But that doesn't mean you can't use it.**

Use the thing, and revisit the theory behind it 6 months later. It's gonna be much easier to grasp.

In the meanwhile, be proud that you're using one of the most remarkable skills that ever existed in humanity ðŸš€
