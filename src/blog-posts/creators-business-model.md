Crazy world we live in.

Ads are everywhere around us, and people completely accept it. They’re so used to them that they don’t even question.

All over the Internet, around them when they walk around the streets; on the TV; radio.

Many apps force you to watch 10-20 second ads, and you cannot continue without watching them.

And what about TV? You watch a movie and suddenly, a 10 minutes series of ads is coming. For most of them, you couldn’t care less. Yet, you fully accept it.

All of those ads coming from multibillion-dollar companies are perfectly fine.

But suddenly, when creators post them, there’s so much hate. Independent people who are trying to do everything to provide value (usually for free) - get so much hate.

Skipping an ad costs you just 0.1s and a finger move to scroll away. Still, there’s so much hate.

On TV, there’s no way to skip that 10-minute ad series. But hey, that’s perfectly fine.

## Creators actually don’t have an unlimited amount of money

Let me tell you something: creators must live. They must eat, drink, buy clothes. They need to pay for rent, buy equipment, book shooting places, try expensive experiences/products for adding them to content, and so many other things.

Obviously, money is needed for it.

And to break the bias: creators don’t have unlimited money.

Even though many think creators just travel around the world and do nothing while using unlimited credit card, it’s absolutely the opposite.

And for many creators that were brave enough to quit their jobs, brand deals are the main source of income.

That’s why, when you see a promo deal, try to be happy for that creator because it means money is coming and more can be invested in better content.

If you can’t be happy, then at least just scroll away without spreading hate. Remember, all the content is provided to you for free, and nobody forces you to watch a promo deal.

## Demystifying the creator's economy

What is actually happening in the background? Seems like rainstorms of money are not randomly pouring on creators, and magic cameras are not flying around them alone and creating content.

Then, what do they do? How do they make money?

### What’s going on in the background

Being a creator is not different from running a business.

In the terms of business, you create a product/service, find a market and sell it (simplified process).

In the terms of content, you create content, find your audience, and distribute it to them.

In both cases, you constantly need to optimise all the processes, otherwise **you die**. But dying is actually a luxury, because most creators and businesses don’t even start to live.

So many businesses fail in the start, generating almost no revenue, just burning money every month.

So many creators start their account, try hard, and abandon them after some time because they can’t go above 1k followers.

## So what creators actually do

You constantly need to experiment and come up with new ideas, because the audience gets bored so easily. You need to fight against the often algorithm changes. You need to deal with comments and messages full of hate. You need to overcome the lowest attention span in the history of humanity.

Besides that, you also need to:

- Manage financials and bookkeeping
- Calculate and pay taxes
- Deal with different legal shit, contracts, etc
- Negotiate deals
- Sell and do marketing
- Edit videos/pictures
- Shoot content
- Invest into new equipment
- Post on social media, engage
- Reply to DMs
- Reply to emails
- ... THE LIST FUCKING GOES ON

The bigger you grow (or better said, the more cash flow you generate), the more you can outsource these tasks and scale.

At the moment, I managed to outsource most of my work, so I just need to write scripts, shoot content, and post/engage.

But it was a wild journey to come to that point. In the beginning, I was doing all these things alone (and many more), while doing my 9-5 because I was earning $75 a month from social media.

There’s a lot of similarities to a startup - as a founder, you wear many hats. Later, as you grow and scale, you double down on what you’re good at and like, while outsourcing everything else. And of course, you still manage the business and manifest your vision. Luckily, you can now afford to say something and have other people do it for you, leaving the time for the biggest decisions.

## And how do creators make money?!?!

There is a lot of different ways, but as I’ve said, promo deals are the main source of income for many successful creators.

What else creators can do is divided into 2 categories:

1. Trading time for money
2. Selling products

### 1. Trading time for money

When you trade time for money, you are doing services for other people. In the creators world, that would be:

- UGC (User Generated Content) - you create content for other brands to post on their channels (not promos on your channels)
- Mentoring

The problem with these is that you trade time for money.

If you want to earn more, you can either:

- Work more, or
- Raise prices.

But there is a limit - the day is never longer than 24 hours, and the hourly rate cannot go infinite.

Another way to increase income is by hiring people, but then, you’re evolving into an agency business model. To earn more money, you need to raise prices and hire people.

It is scalable. But way harder than the other way of earning:

### 2. Selling products:

- Courses
- eBooks
- Community memberships
- Physical products
- ... The list goes on

What is amazing here is that if you want to earn 10x more, you don’t need to hire 10x people. You can just change your marketing strategy and, who knows, maybe even get 100x better results.

So, **it’s highly scalable**. I love it.

## How I currently make money

I’m falling into that group of creators who earn most of their income from promo deals.

I do have 3 more things:

- Course about content creation and monetisation on social media
- Coding course for breaking into tech
- Online store (clothing brand)

I love all the products, but I probably suck at marketing so I still don’t earn enough to support my (lavish) lifestyle. My plan is to hire marketing peeps who will take care of these things, it’s happening soon.

Ah, the power of marketing. At the moment, I regularly do $30k+ months just from social media, have a [course](https://www.techwizzdom.com/500k-content-wizzard) where I teach **everything** I know about it, yet people don’t want to pay $200 to do the same. Seems like it's better to spend $500 for a shopping you don’t need than to invest in yourself.

Anyways, that’s why I still do promo brands. Would I love to do less of them? Well, sometimes probably yes. But I need the money to invest more into the business, scale, and increase other sources of income.

I still reject many brands because I don’t think they fit with my audience. My goal with every promo deal is to:

- Help the brand,
- Present cool things to my audience,
- And of course, earn some money because... I don’t live from the air?

So when you see another promo deal, don’t be mad. Don’t spread hate.

Be happy for an independent person who quit their job and is experimenting in this crazy world.

Be aware that promo brands mean better content.

Creators work hard in an unknown territory. If you don’t like their content, just unfollow and that’s it.

But don’t spread hate because you saw a promo deal from which you can scroll away in 0.3 seconds.

Change the perspective. In the end, you probably pay nothing for their content anyway.
