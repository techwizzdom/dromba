      <H1>
        Courses these days are too long. Too detailed. Filled with too much
        useless information.
      </H1>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Large} />
      <H3 isThin>
        There's no reason to learn complex JavaScript concepts that even Senior
        developers struggle with. Nobody will ask about them on interviews - so
        what's the point of trying to understand something you won't understand
        and need at the moment? Waste of time and energy.
      </H3>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Giant} />
      <H1>
        Your main goal when starting learning to code should be getting a job.
      </H1>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Large} />
      <H3 isThin>
        No, not learning. Not making 259358 side projects. Not solving countless
        Leetcode challenges.
      </H3>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Giant} />
      <H1>Let me explain.</H1>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Large} />
      <H3 isThin>
        The best place to learn is a company. You'll start learning properly
        when you get your first job; when you will be surrounded by other
        experienced engineers 8 hours per day; when you'll be working on massive
        real projects. Everything before - is just a preparation.
      </H3>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Giant} />
      <H1>Don't waste time preparing, when you can already earn big.</H1>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Large} />
      <H3 isThin>
        Focus on important things that will actually need you to get that first
        job. In those extra 6-12 months of learning useless programming
        concepts, you could have already had a job, learn for real, and earn
        big.
      </H3>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Giant} />
      <H1>
        And that's exactly what this course is about. Learn only the things you
        need in a most effiecient way. Get the job fast, and start earning fast.

      <H1>FAQ</H1>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Large} />
      <H3>Hey Dom, why does this course exist?</H3>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Medium} />
      <Paragraph size={ParagraphSize.Large}>
        It's here because so many people are asking me to recommend a perfect
        course. And I can't. There's too many of them, going into too much
        details. I want you to start fucking earning big money, fast. This is
        not a college, and learning for exams. This is real life, real projects,
        real money.
      </Paragraph>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Large} />
      <H3>Why should I trust you?</H3>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Medium} />
      <Paragraph size={ParagraphSize.Large}>
        I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer, coding for 7+ years. I worked in many
        different enviroments, on a countless number of projects, with
        exceptional enngineers. I've been mentoring people, interviewing them,
        reviewing their code.I know the industry - I know what's needed and what
        not.
      </Paragraph>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Small} />
      <Paragraph size={ParagraphSize.Large}>
        Also, I'm @tech_wizzdom on socials, with half a million followers across
        platforms. I've received a massive number of compliments about my simple
        explanations.
      </Paragraph>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Small} />
      <Paragraph size={ParagraphSize.Large}>
        So I decided to summarise everything you need to break into tech, and
        make a course out if it. I gave my best - whether you'll trust me or
        not, it's up to you.
      </Paragraph>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Large} />
      <H3>You're cool! What will I learn?</H3>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Medium} />
      <Paragraph size={ParagraphSize.Large}>
        We'll start with HTML, move to CSS, then JavaScript, and then React.
      </Paragraph>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Small} />
      <Paragraph size={ParagraphSize.Large}>
        You'll also learn git and GitHub, Figma (a design tool in which
        designers create designs, and give them to developers to create apps).
      </Paragraph>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Small} />
      <Paragraph size={ParagraphSize.Large}>
        Finally, we'll deploy your apps on a public URL. Yes, you will be able
        to send with your apps to anyone.
      </Paragraph>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Large} />
      <H3>Will I create some projects?</H3>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Medium} />
      <Paragraph size={ParagraphSize.Large}>
        Of course! We'll make a beautiful modern website, and you'll be sending
        it to your future employers. We'll also create 2 other apps, one with
        pure JavaScript, and one with React.
      </Paragraph>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Large} />
      <H3>Can I just watch YouTube videos for free, why should I pay?</H3>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Medium} />
      <Paragraph size={ParagraphSize.Large}>
        Sure you can - all of this knowledge is available somewhere online. But
        the thing is - nobody knows where. The tech field is so massive that
        it's gonna be challenging to break into it either way.
      </Paragraph>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Small} />
      <Paragraph size={ParagraphSize.Large}>
        On YouTube, you'll be seeing so many different videos from a countless
        number of teacher - all of them with different teaching styles. And you
        could be lost in all that.
      </Paragraph>
      <VerticalSpacing height={VerticalSpacingHeight.Small} />
      <Paragraph size={ParagraphSize.Large}>
        Not only that you won't have a structured content, but you also won't
        have a clue what to learn, and what not to. Meaning, you'll be spending
        a lot of time on learning useless things. And time is money. The price
        for the course is nothing, considering that you will be earning 6
        figures soon. Invest in yourself, that's the highest ROI.
